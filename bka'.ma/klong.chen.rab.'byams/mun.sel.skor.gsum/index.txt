	Longchenpa's three commentaries on the Guhyagarbha Tantra.

	Guhyagarbha Tantra (Skt.; Tib. Gyü Sangwé Nyingpo; Wyl. rgyud gsang ba'i snying po),
	The Essence of Secrets Tantra — the main tantra of the Mahayoga.
	For centuries, detailed study of its root verses and many celebrated commentaries,
	including Longchenpa's Trilogy of Dispelling Darkness,
	Dodrupchen Jikmé Tenpé Nyima's Key to the Precious Treasury and
	Mipham Rinpoche's Essence of Clear Light, has been the key to
	understanding the Vajrayana’s most prominent themes and practices,
	such as empowerment, samaya, mantra recitation and the use of mandalas.
