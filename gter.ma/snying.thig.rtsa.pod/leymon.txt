On top of a wish-fulfilling tree, the auspicious coincidence of karma and aspiration,
The youthful peacock of eastern India has arrived.
When the display of the peacock becomes holy Dharma,
We youthful ones are set onto the path of liberation.
On the chariot of the meritorious queen of spring,
From the tree-groves of Mon in the South has come the cuckoo-bird with its sweet song,
Sweeter than the music of the flutes of the daughters of the gandharva above.
How good the excellent coincidence of the flourishing three months of summer!
Gathered here are the vajra brothers and sisters whose karma and aspirations are in accord.
Please come to this Dharma assembly where our guru dwells.
At this festival we drink the amrita that ripens and frees,
And from that comes the special Dharma of singing the songs of joyful experience.
Among these rows of unchanging great bliss,
Even when not meditating, we witness the faces of the deity and the guru.
By means of the yana of luminosity, the heart-essence of the mother and dakinis,
Please grant me siddhi--the rainbow body, the dharmakaya!

On the wish-fulfiling tree of karma  linked with good wishes
The youthful peacock of East India has landed
Turn your tail parasol to face the sacred teachings
So we youngsters can also step onto the path of freedom

In the Queen of Spring's chariot of merit
The melodioud voice of the chuckoo bird from the jungle of south Buthan has arrived
With song sweeter that the flute of celestial maidens
We receive the auspicious omen of a joyful summer season

Vajra brothers and companions, assembled here with harmonious karma and wishes
Our teacher is present and has arrived ar the gathering of Dharma
During this feast of drinking the nectar of ripening and liberation
I have the special task of singing a joyful song
Amid this gathering of unchanging great bliss
We behold the countenance of the yidam and guru even without meditation
So let us request the siddhi of attaining the rainbow body of dharmakaya
Through the vehicle of luminocity clarity, the heart essence of the mother dakinis
