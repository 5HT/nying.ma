The parpu or 'first fruit' printings were sent to the great spiritual masters of the time shortly after the carving was complete. One of them reached the 13th Karmapa Dudul Dorje (1733/1734-1797/1798). It was this copy that was eventually reproduced in India at the order of H.H. the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje (1924-1981). Later protectors of the Derge Gonchen printery added texts including new translations by Situ, which he, out of his natural humility, had omitted to include in his own edition of the canon. These additional texts are found in later printings from the Derge blocks.</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan=1 width=150 valign=top>&nbsp;</td><td colspan=3 valign=top><br><pre style='font-size:20pt;'></pre></td></tr></table></body></html>
