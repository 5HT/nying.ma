The Tengyur is a collection of basic texts translated from Indic originals and ranging over the entire range of learning. Their chief characteristic is that all of them have been written by Indian authors. The catalog to this edition is highly regarded as a historical source for Tibet and the Derge principality. The edition which has been scanned here was prepared as a part of the funeral rites for H.H. the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje (1924-1981) who passed away in Chicago. The set reproduced here is missing the Jo bo chos chung brgya rtsa which seems to have been added later.</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan=1 width=150 valign=top>&nbsp;</td><td colspan=3 valign=top><br><pre style='font-size:20pt;'></pre></td></tr></table></body></html>
