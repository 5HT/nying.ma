<H2 class="h3"><A name="n22f4608defd9e1561" id="n22f4608defd9e1561">Prologue</A></H2>
<P>In Sanskrit, (this text) is called <EM><SPAN class="tool" title="dharma:(1) Preventive measures which, if one puts into practice or achieves, prevent the experience of future suffering. (2) Buddha&lsquo;s teachings. (3) Any phenomenon or &#39;thing.&#39;">Dharma</SPAN>-chatur-ratna-mala</EM>. In Tibetan, it is called <EM>Chos-bzhi rin-po-che’i ‘phreng-ba</EM>. [In English, it is called <EM>A Precious Garland</EM> <EM>for the Four Themes (of Gampopa)</EM>.]</P>
<P>I prostrate to all the <SPAN class="tool" title="Buddha:A fully enlightened being; someone who has totally eliminated, forever, from his or her mental continuum both the emotional and cognitive obscurations.">Buddhas</SPAN> and <SPAN class="tool" title="bodhisattva:Someone who has developed unlabored bodhichitta.">bodhisattvas</SPAN>.</P>
<P>(1) With a crown of a hundred-fold belief in what’s fact, I make <SPAN class="tool" title="offering:Something presented, with respect and the intention to bring happiness and benefit, to someone else.">offerings</SPAN> to you, O sun(like Buddhas) Gone to Bliss. In the sphere of the space of your naturally (abiding) Dharmakaya (a <SPAN class="tool" title="The omniscient mind of a Buddha">Corpus Encompassing Everything</SPAN>), the <SPAN class="tool" title="">mandala</SPAN>-disc of your <SPAN class="tool" title="Corpus of Forms:A network of forms in which a Buddha appears in order to benefit others. It includes both the subtle forms of a Corpus of Full Use and the grosser forms of a Corpus of Emanations, Also called: Corpus of Enlightening Forms, Form Body, Body of Forms.">Corpus of Forms</SPAN> having five certainties spreads forth and <SPAN class="tool" title="cause:A nonstatic phenomenon able to bring about the production or arising of something.">causes</SPAN> the lotus (<SPAN class="tool" title="mind:The cognitive activity of merely giving rise to an appearance or mental hologram of something knowable and cognitively engaging with it.">minds</SPAN>) of disciples to blossom through the rays of your <SPAN class="tool" title="According to Mahayana, a set of twelve actions or deeds in the life of a Buddha, with which a Buddha demonstrates to all limited beings the way to achieve enlightenment.">enlightening deeds</SPAN>.</P>
<P>(2) The cool shade of the precious wish-granting tree of the ways of the Triumphant One’s Dharma offers protection from all the torments of compulsive (samsaric) <SPAN class="tool" title="existents:Validly knowable phenomena.">existence</SPAN> and complacent (<SPAN class="tool" title="An extinguished state of release -- either an acquired one, in which all samsaric sufferings and their causes have been removed, or a naturally occurring one, in which all stains of impossible existence have always been removed. The Tibetan term means, literally, &#39;a state beyond sorrow.&#39;">nirvana</SPAN>. Therefore,) as a way for all beings with belief in what’s fact to enter (into its shade), step by step, I shall explain the massive tree of <SPAN class="tool" title="Helpful aspects or beneficial talents of a person that are corrections of inadequacies.">good qualities</SPAN> of the four aspects (of the Dharma). Listen well.</P>
<H2 class="h3"><A name="n22f4608defd9e1562" id="n22f4608defd9e1562">1 Having the Mind Go toward the Dharma</A></H2>
<H3 class="h4"><A name="n22f4608defd9e1563" id="n22f4608defd9e1563">Precious Human Rebirth</A></H3>
<P>(3) What anyone who wishes to cross the boundless ocean of recurring samsaric existence first must think is to make full effort, right now in this lifetime, to achieve the stilling and the <SPAN class="tool" title="A state of mind, either tainted or untainted, characterized by varying levels of intensity of happiness. Some of the untainted ones can be utilized in anuttarayoga tantra practice as the type of awareness with which to focus on voidness, and as an aid for dissolving the energy-winds in the central channel in order to gain access to clear light awareness.">blissful awareness</SPAN> that are the <SPAN class="tool" title="A validly knowable object that holds its own individual self-nature.">phenomenon</SPAN> of <SPAN class="tool" title="The state of an arhat; the state in which one has attained a true stopping of true suffering and the true origins of suffering, and thus a true stopping of samsara; the state in which one has attained a true stopping of the emotional obscurations.">liberation</SPAN>.</P>
<P>(4) At (this) <SPAN class="tool" title="An interval imputed or measured in the continuum of the occurrence of a sequence of cause and effect. Since time is conceptually imputable, time is a function of and therefore relative to the mind that conceptually imputes it.">time</SPAN> when you have <SPAN class="tool" title="obtainer:A set of four disturbing emotions and disturbing attitudes: (1) obtainer desire, (2) an obtainer deluded outlook, (3) holding deluded morality or conduct as supreme, and (4) asserting one&lsquo;s identity, and which, when occurring at the time of death, constitute the ninth link of dependent arising.">obtained</SPAN> the ship of a (human) body, with <SPAN class="tool" title="respite:A temporary rest or a break from a state of no leisure for Dharma practice, such as the worst states of rebirth. Some translators render the term as a &#39;freedom&#39; or a &#39;liberty.&#39;">respites</SPAN> and enrichments, difficult to find and easily lost, if you do not exert yourself, you will never liberate yourself from the ocean of <SPAN class="tool" title="Existence under the control of karma and disturbing emotions and attitudes. Synonym for uncontrollably recurring existence, samsara.">compulsive existence</SPAN> or break the continuity of having many and varied (kinds of) sufferings.</P>
<P>(5) You will be tossed about in this unbearable, fearsome great ocean (of <SPAN class="tool" title="Uncontrollably recurring rebirth under the power of disturbing emotions and attitudes and of karma. Some translators render it as &#39;cyclic existence.&#39;">samsara</SPAN>), where an end to the current of birth and death is not evident, where streaks of foam of sickness and old age thicken everywhere, and where the tides of disturbing emotions spread everywhere, up to the far reaches of the highest realm of compulsive existence.</P>
<P>(6) (But) whoever hears (the Dharma teachings) will be able to break the continuum of birth and death and will never be parted from a supremely great blissful <SPAN class="tool" title="The most general, all-inclusive term for cognizing an object. It is used in the sense of both being aware of something and making something an object of awareness, but not necessarily as a conscious act of will or knowing what the object is.">awareness</SPAN>. (Therefore,) with the excellent and precious ship (of a fully endowed human body), make efforts in the supreme Dharma, (which brings) a stilling, in order to cross the repository of waters of the disturbing emotions of the three planes of existence.</P>
<P>(7) If this time around you have not practised toward <SPAN class="tool" title="actualize:To attain a spiritual goal. To make the attainment of a spiritual goal really (actually) happen. Also translated as &#39;attain&#39; and &#39;attainment.&#39;">actualizing</SPAN> a <SPAN class="tool" title="The state of a shravaka arhat, pratyekabuddha arhat, or a Buddha, in which the mental continuum of the person attaining this state has been purified of either the emotional obscurations or both the emotional and the cognitive obscurations.">purified state</SPAN> with a pathway of mind (that leads) to liberation, in the future you will never even hear the <SPAN class="tool" title="A combination of sounds that are assigned a meaning.">name</SPAN> <EM>fortunate rebirth</EM>, and, through endless unfortunate rebirths, one after the next, you will lack any methods for liberating yourself from eternally remaining in uncontrollably recurring samsaric existence.</P>
<P>(8) Therefore, people with sense, having now attained a human body of respites and enrichments, practise to achieve (a state of) benefit and bliss, with great effort from your hearts, and by means of this, come to fulfil the aims of both yourself and others.</P>
<H3 class="h4"><A name="n22f4608defd9e1564" id="n22f4608defd9e1564">Death and Impermanence</A></H3>
<P>(9) Even if you have attained the respites and enrichments, there is never any mental security. As all things are unstable, ever-changing, without any essence, momentary, <SPAN class="tool" title="nonstaticness:The noncongruent affecting variable of changing from moment to moment, under the influence of causes and circumstances. Sometimes translated as &#39;impermanence.&#39;">nonstatic</SPAN>, disintegrating phenomena, think from your hearts, “Soon I shall die, all of a sudden.”</P>
<P>(10) It is the same as well with the entire <SPAN class="tool" title="perishing:The nonstatic, affected phenomenon of the ceasing of the present-happening of something.">perishable</SPAN> world of your environment. At the times of its disintegration through seven fires, one flood, or wind, everything will become void, without even a remnant of a tip of a hair left: there will be only space.</P>
<P>(11) Its inhabitants, nonstatic <SPAN class="tool" title="wandering being:A being that &#39;wanders&#39; from one uncontrollably recurring rebirth to the next; a being caught in samsara. Synonymous with &#39;limited being&#39; (sentient being).">wandering beings</SPAN>, ever are moving. No matter how many <SPAN class="tool" title="limited being:A being still having limited awareness. Any being other than a Buddha. Often rendered as &#39;sentient being.&#39;">limited beings</SPAN> there may be – divine (godly) beings, the <SPAN class="tool" title="A class of limited beings characerized by extreme jealousy toward the divine beings, with whom they contually fight. Also translated as &#39;quasi-divine beings,&#39; &#39;anti-gods,&#39; or simply as &#39;asuras.&#39;">would-be divine</SPAN>, humans, animals, <SPAN class="tool" title="clutching ghost:One of the three worse rebirth states, characterized by the suffering of being unable to satisfy basic needs, such as hunger and thirst, and caused primarily by miserliness. Translated by most others as &#39;hungry ghost,&#39; which is a literal rendering of the Chinese translation for the term, adopted by the Chinese in reference to the spirits of departed ancestors that suffered when not presented with regular offerings of food.">clutching ghosts</SPAN>, or joyless realm beings – when their time is up, they must plunge into the waters of death, transference, and rebirth.</P>
<P>(12) Years, months, days, seasons, and <SPAN class="tool" title="moment:The smallest unit of time.">moments</SPAN> are impermanent, disintegrate, and march on. As you have sadness with the changing of the four seasons, think about how your own time, too, will be impermanent.</P>
<P>(13) There is no mental security: very soon your body and life-force will part (from each other. Therefore,) from today on, think with certitude, “It is uncertain which will occur first, tomorrow or the time when my life shall be spent.”</P>
<H3 class="h4"><A name="n22f4608defd9e1565" id="n22f4608defd9e1565">The Shortcomings of Samsara</A></H3>
<P>(14) The sufferings of rebirth are more frightening than those of death. There is never any <SPAN class="tool" title="That feeling which, when it stops, we wish to meet with it again.">happiness</SPAN> no matter where you are reborn, for the <SPAN class="tool" title="The nature of a phenomenon defined in terms of the function that the phenomenon performs.">functional nature</SPAN> of recurring samsara is like that of a pit of fire. (Therefore,) seek a method to liberate yourself from it right now.</P>
<P>(15) Joyless realm beings suffer from heat and cold, clutching ghosts from hunger and thirst, and animals by devouring each other, stupidity, and being muddleheaded. Humans are tormented by the three and the eight faults, the would-be divine by fighting and quarrelling, and <SPAN class="tool" title="divine being:A limited (sentient) being in the rebirth state that, out of the six states of rebirth, has the least amount of suffering. This class of being includes some that are on the plane of sensory desires, and all beings on the plane of ethereal forms and the plane of formelss beings. Also called a &#39;god.&#39;">divine beings</SPAN> by death, transference, and falling (to lower rebirths).</P>
<P>(16) The happiness (of the divine beings) may change into grief and their affective suffering abounds. After their lives transfer from the pleasures associated with the <SPAN class="tool" title="divine realm:A place where divine beings (gods) dwell. Also called a &#39;heaven.&#39;">divine realms</SPAN>, they may once again enter the fires of a joyless realm. Having thought like this, work to pass beyond compulsive existence.</P>
<P>(17) The <SPAN class="tool" title="appearance:The mental hologram (mental representation) of any external or internal object of cognition, which arises in the mind. Also called &#39;cognitive appearance.&#39;">appearances</SPAN> of this life are like a dream just as you are about to wake up. They are changing and impermanent. Because you must go on, after having left them behind, what can retinue, wealth and such do for you? Make effort in the Dharma right now!</P>
<H3 class="h4"><A name="n22f4608defd9e1566" id="n22f4608defd9e1566">Developing a Stilled and Settled State of Shamatha</A></H3>
<P>(18) Desire is like poison, weapons, or fire. Tormented (by it), there is never a chance for happiness. There is suffering through accumulating, protecting, and increasing (what you desire, and consequently) you are always bound by arrogance, greed, and stinginess. Having quarrels with everyone, the <SPAN class="tool" title="tainted:Something that derives from a disturbing emotion or attitude, or is related in some way with a disturbing emotion or attitude. According to Vasubandhu, they give rise to further tainted phenomena; while according to Asanga, only some do that. Also translated as &#39;mixed with confusion. Some translators render this term as &#39;contaminated.&#39;">taints</SPAN> of your disturbing emotions increase. You have <SPAN class="tool" title="A subsidiary awareness (mental factor) that causes the mind to lose concentration and to go on and on, uncontrollably from one object to another, due to any reason.">mental wandering</SPAN> with busy-work and it threatens your body and life.</P>
<P>(19) Having your aims and <SPAN class="tool" title="activate:To cause a karmic tendency to become a manifest karmic impulse that will give its result in the next moment. Also translated as &#39;arouse.&#39; Tibetan alternative: nus-pa mthu-can-du byed-pa.">activities</SPAN> be too numerous and contradictory to the Dharma is always scorned by the highly realized <SPAN class="tool" title="arya:A practitioner who has had nonconceptual cognition of the four noble truths and thus has attained a shravaka, pratyekabuddha, or bodhisattva seeing pathway of mind (path of seeing). Also called a &#39;highly realized practitioner&#39; or a &#39;highly realized being.&#39; Some translators render the term as &#39;noble one.&#39;">aryas</SPAN>. (But) for those whose desires are few, <SPAN class="tool" title="States of mind, or physical, verbal, or mental actions motivated by them, which ripen into happiness to be experienced by the person on whose mental continuum they occur. Since the term carries no connotation of moral judgment, the translation &#39;virtuous&#39; is misleading for this term.">constructive</SPAN> (activities and qualities) automatically increase. Therefore, those (of you) who would enter into a pathway of mind (that leads) to liberation, which is a stilled state, make your desires be few and have contentment.</P>
<P>(20) It is said that if you exhaust your desires, you are a <SPAN class="tool" title="A nontechnical term for what actually exists.">real</SPAN> arya; and if your desires are few, you are of the arya type. Just as suffering and disturbing emotions increase for those with desire, what is constructive naturally increases for those whose desires are few. Therefore, by following in the footsteps of the <SPAN class="tool" title="Pure and worthy of the highest respect; sacred.">hallowed</SPAN> beings of the past, be always content and make your possessions be few.</P>
<P>(21) The faults of associating with people are indeed without limit. There is far too much useless distraction and activities. <SPAN class="tool" title="anger:A root disturbing emotion, aimed at another limited being, one&lsquo;s own suffering, or situations entailing suffering, and which is impatient with them and wishes to get rid of them, such as by damaging or hurting them, or by striking out against them. It is based on regarding its object as unattractive or repulsive by its very nature.">Anger</SPAN>, arguments, and fighting increase, and attraction and repulsion arise. You always become infected with suffering and that’s pointless.</P>
<P>(22) No matter what you have done, there is never a time when you can please (others). No matter how you try to teach them (the Dharma), the chances to benefit (them) are slim. Likewise, even when you listen (to them), it’s never the excellent Dharma. Even if you are close (to them) as friends, in the end you will have to part.</P>
<P>(23) Therefore, rid yourself completely of close relationships of dependency on followers, friends, or relatives, and make a definite effort, from today on, to practise the hallowed Dharma, alone in isolation.</P>
<P>(24) Supreme hallowed beings of the past have said that from living in isolation, they found the nectar (of Dharma experience). Therefore, (resolve that) I too shall live alone in isolation in a forest in order to actualize a state of being stilled.</P>
<P>(25) Living in isolation has been praised by the Triumphant (Buddhas). With no one unruly (around you), you increase your <SPAN class="tool" title="Perfect concentration fully absorbed or sunk into an object of focus.">absorbed concentration</SPAN> on what is profound. You naturally practise the Dharma and develop sombre thoughts of impermanence. You put material possessions aside and have no busy-work or distractions.</P>
<P>(26) Your bountiful stores of belief in what’s fact, <SPAN class="tool" title="(1) The definite determination to be free of samsara and to gain liberation, and with which one is willing to give up true suffering and true causes. Also translated as &#39;determination to be free.&#39; (2) In Theravada, the mental factor to give up all attachment to worldly possessions, social status, and even one&lsquo;s body. When conjoined with a bodhichitta aim, it becomes a far-reaching attitude.">renunciation</SPAN>, and good qualities enlarge and, not having close relationships, automatically your activities decrease. Therefore, without (concern for) the <SPAN class="tool" title="Praise or criticism, good or bad news, gains or losses, things going well or poorly -- or, more specifically, the emotional ups and downs of overexcitement and depression in response to these eight. Also called the &#39;eight worldly dharmas.&#39;">eight transitory things in life</SPAN>, or for keeping the minds of others (happy) or saving face, pass your days and nights with the Dharma in the bliss associated with being under your own control.</P>
<P>(27) Making your respites and enrichments have meaning and taking the essence of your attainment (of them) – as words cannot encompass those and more benefits, practise absorbed concentration on the profound (Dharma) for your entire life, alone, in the middle of a totally isolated forest.</P>
<P>(28) May the cooling rain of the Dharma, well spoken like that, after stilling (all) disturbing emotions and tormenting <SPAN class="tool" title="Together with a concept.">conceptual</SPAN> thoughts, fill the pond of lotuses, which are constructive masses of absorbed concentrations, and (thus) spread an endowment of a stilled state.</P>
<P>This (concludes) the first chapter of <EM>A Precious Garland</EM> <EM>for the Four Themes (of Gampopa)</EM>, “Having the Mind Go toward the Dharma.”</P>

<H3 class="h4"><A name="n22f4608defd9e1568" id="n22f4608defd9e1568">The Necessity for Having the Dharma Function as a Pathway of Mind</A></H3>
<P>(29) Those of you who wish for a pathway of mind (that leads) to liberation, having, through belief in what’s fact, engaged yourselves with the supreme, lustrous, hallowed Dharma like that – cherish making the Dharma go (within you) as a pathway of mind, in order that your very mind becomes fully tamed.</P>
<P>(30) There are those who have engaged themselves with the teachings of the Triumphant (Buddhas) like this and have even embarked on hearing, thinking, and <SPAN class="tool" title="meditation:The repeated practice of generating and focusing on a beneficial state of mind in order to build it up as a habit.">meditating</SPAN> (on them). Yet some have not stilled (their disturbing emotions): their <SPAN class="tool" title="mental continuum:The stream of continuity of mental activity (mind, awareness) of an individual being, which has no beginning, which continues even into Buddhahood, and, according to Mahayana, has no end. According to the Hinayana tenets, it comes to an end when an arhat or Buddha dies at the end of the lifetime in which the person attains liberation or enlightenment. Also called a &#39;mind-stream.&#39;">mental continuums</SPAN> are worse. Some engage themselves with distorted pathways of mind, or inferior ones, or pathways of mind that lead astray.</P>
<P>(31) (Some have) great desires and <SPAN class="tool" title="The subsidiary awareness (mental factor) of a strong longing desire to experience something in the future that one may or may not be experiencing at present. The Sanskrit term means, literally, &#39;thirst.&#39;">craving</SPAN>, and (some are) distracted with (concerns for) this life and the like. All those faults, contradictory to the Dharma, have come from their not having made that Dharma go (within them) as a pathway of mind. The faults (that come) from that in this and future (lives) are boundless.</P>
<P>(32) Whoever is fooled by (such) <SPAN class="tool" title="deceptive:Being mistaken or confusing with respect to the appearance of something.">deception</SPAN> will be (filled with) <SPAN class="tool" title="The subsidiary awareness (mental factor) of not wishing to repeat doing something, either proper or improper, that one did or that someone else made one do.">regret</SPAN> at the time of death, will have terror and anxiety in the <SPAN class="tool" title="The state of existence from the moment immediately after death until the moment immediately before conception. Translated as the &#39;inbetween state.&#39;">bardo</SPAN> in-between period, will go to worse rebirth states in the future, and not have the opportunity to liberate themselves forever from compulsive existence. Therefore, make the Dharma go (within you) as a pathway of mind.</P>
<P>(33) Just as you may improperly even take hygienic medicine as an antidote for a sickness, yet since it was in fact improperly (taken), it would make you even more tormented than you were tormented (before); likewise, what use is the Dharma if you have not made it go as an antidote? Therefore, as there are boundless faults like that; O people having belief in what’s fact, understand this well.</P>
<H3 class="h4"><A name="n22f4608defd9e1569" id="n22f4608defd9e1569">Entrusting Yourself to <SPAN class="tool" title="spiritual mentor:A Buddhist teacher who has had stable realizations, who embodies the teachings in the sense of having integrated them into his or her life, and who confers vows on disciples.">Spiritual Mentors</SPAN></A></H3>
<P>(34) Concerning that, since making that Dharma go (within you) as a pathway of mind depends, first of all, on spiritual mentors, cherish entrusting yourself to qualified hallowed gurus. All excellent bounteous good qualities come from that.</P>
<P>(35) As for that, entrust yourself fully and with great (respect and) <SPAN class="tool" title="Valuing something highly, usually the kindness of someone. Often used in the context of appreciating the kindness of one&lsquo;s spiritual mentor.

They are without a basis, without a <SPAN class="tool" title="support:(1) An individual defining characteristic mark findable on the side of a knowable object, upon which a word or label for the object is set. (2) See: &#39;something that supports something else.&#39;">support</SPAN>, and without an (actual) beginning, middle, or end. Know that, by functional nature, they are pure from the start.</P>
<P>(68) Concerning (all) phenomena like this – the samsaric world of appearances: environments and their inhabitants – there are no (true) cognitive objects to be taken. They are like magical emanations or visual apparitions. And there are no (true) limited minds to cognitively take them (as objects. All is) pure like empty space. (Since) there is no (true) pair: cognitive objects to be taken and (limited minds) that cognitively take them, samsara has never been (validly) experienced as being (truly) existent. Liberate (yourself) by knowing that (samsara) is an appearance of what doesn’t (truly) exist and has the functional nature of being deceptive.</P>
<P>(69) Because the appearances of things to be abandoned or adopted, causes, effects, and circumstances naturally purify themselves away, know that, on the deepest level, their abiding nature is beyond cause and effect. The basis support for this (natural purification) is <SPAN class="tool" title="In the dozgchen system, the subtlest level of awareness, which is totally untainted by any of the fleeting stains of mental obscurations. It is devoid of all grosser levels of awareness and yet permeates all of them, and it spontaneously establishes pure appearances. Often left untranslated as &#39;rigpa.&#39;">pure awareness</SPAN>, <EM>rigpa</EM>, the (<SPAN class="tool" title="deepest bodhichitta:The deep awareness that has nonconceptual cognition of voidness.">deepest) bodhichitta</SPAN> mind. The sphere of (naturally) released nirvana, the great spontaneous establisher (of all appearances – this is) the <SPAN class="tool" title="In the Mahayana tenet systems, a true fact about a phenomenon that is veiled or concealed by a more superficial true fact about the same phenomenon. Some translators render this term as &#39;ultimate truth.&#39;">deepest truth</SPAN>, pure from the start.</P>
<P>(70) In other words, with an identity-nature of being without a beginning and without an end, (pure awareness) is the clear light mind in its <SPAN class="tool" title="Something on the side of an object or phenomenon that (1) establishes the existence, in general, of the object or phenomenon and (2) establishes, as well, what the object or phenomenon is. A self-nature may do this either by its own power alone, or by its own power in conjunction with mental labeling. The term may also be translated as &#39;self-establishing nature.&#39;">self-nature</SPAN> – profound, stilled, and parted from mental fabrication. It is (the deep awareness) naturally abiding from the depths, a stainless Dharmakaya Corpus Encompassing Everything. It abides as an essential nature, without shifting or changing over the three times.</P>
<P>(71) This is the sphere of the basis, the diamond-strong vajra essence. In other words, whoever has stable realization of that (pure awareness) has the (correct) view itself of the abiding nature; and, with interpolation and <SPAN class="tool" title="A conceptual denial of something that is true or is present.">repudiation</SPAN> stilled, has stable realization of it as the heart-essence of the deepest level.</P>

<P>(72) Stainless meditation, (done) within a state of stable realization of the heart-essence of the clear light mind, is parted from <SPAN class="tool" title="A mental factor (subsidiary awareness) faulting the appearance-making of mindfulness&lsquo;s mental hold on an object of focus. Some translators render the term as &#39;sinking.&#39;">mental dullness</SPAN>, <SPAN class="tool" title="The mental factor with which the mind wanders to an object of attraction, due to desire for it or attachment, and which faults the mental abiding of mindfulness&lsquo;s mental hold on an object of focus. Sometimes translated as &#39;mental agitation.&#39;">flightiness of mind</SPAN>, and mental fabrication. It is without distraction, parted from the dualistic mind, and extremely expansive. In other words, it is completely pure like the sky, without restriction or selective bias, beyond all thought, expression, and imagination.</P>

<P>(73) As for behavior, whatever appears has no <SPAN class="tool" title="true existence:(1) An impossible mode of existence mistakenly considered to be true. Existence established or proven (a) merely by the power of something on the side of an object and not in conjunction with being something imputable on a basis, according to Gelug Svatantrika-Madhyamaka, or (b) by the power of something on the side of an object, either by itself or in conjunction with being something imputable on a basis, according to Gelug Prasangika-Madhyamaka. (2) A mode of existence that is true. Existence established or proven by (a) arising from causes and conditions, according to Jetsunpa and Kunkhyen Gelug Sautrantika, or (b) the power of something on the side of an object, according to Panchen Gelug Sautrantika and Gelug Chittamatra. Also translated as &#39;truly established existence.&#39;">true (existence</SPAN>): it purifies itself away. (Thus, concerning) internal (limited minds) taking (objects), any that <SPAN class="tool" title="A verb used for the arising of a cognitive appearance on a mental continuum, in analogy with the sun rising at dawn.">dawn</SPAN> naturally liberate themselves (by automatically dissolving. And concerning) external (objects) cognitively taken, they are like a dream or an illusion. On the deepest level, there isn’t the pair, and (so) act without adopting or discarding.</P>
<H3 class="h4"><A name="n22f4608defd9e15618" id="n22f4608defd9e15618">Recapitulation of Dzogchen</A></H3>
<P>(74) Regarding (limited minds) taking (objects, objects) cognitively taken, disturbing emotions and attitudes, negation and affirmation phenomena – in arising, they are automatically liberating themselves. (That is to say,) with knowing their functional nature, (you know that they automatically) liberate themselves. With their liberating themselves, then within a state of equality in Dharmakaya, complete from the depths, there is no need to seek a nirvana from having an abandonment of samsara.</P>
<P>(75) Whatever (cognitive objects) appear, they are mirrors revealing the deepest (level). Whatever (limited minds) dawn, (that cognitively take them), know that they automatically liberate themselves. They are the effulgent display of a Dharmakaya. Like water and waves, they have a singular support in Dharmakaya. This is the (Buddhas’) intended point concerning the ultimate level, the very summit of views, the great completeness, dzogchen.</P>
<H3 class="h4"><A name="n22f4608defd9e15619" id="n22f4608defd9e15619">Summary</A></H3>
<P>(76) In short, whoever practices in any of these ways, (know that) grasping for an impossible “ soul” automatically liberates itself and disturbing emotions and attitudes purify away in the sphere (of voidness). Being skilled in the pathways of acting with (these) methods in all (situations) is taught as (the way for) having the pathway minds eliminate confusion.</P>
<P>(77) May all beings, without exception, cross the ocean of compulsive existence by means of the precious great ship of (these) ways of the Dharma like that, and, on the supreme island of a stilled state of precious liberation, behold a banquet of an <SPAN class="tool" title="Something that does not derive from a disturbing emotion or attitude, or is not related in any way with a disturbing emotion or attitude. Also translated as &#39;unmixed with confusion&#39; or &#39;dissociated from confusion.&#39; Many translators render this term as &#39;uncontaminated.&#39;">untainted</SPAN> stilling and bliss.</P>
<P>This (concludes) the third chapter of <EM>A Precious Garland</EM> <EM>for the Four Themes of (Gampopa)</EM>, “Having the Pathway Minds Eliminate Confusion.”</P>
<H2 class="h3"><A name="n22f4608defd9e15620" id="n22f4608defd9e15620">4 Purifying Confusion into Deep Awareness</A></H2>
<H3 class="h4"><A name="n22f4608defd9e15621" id="n22f4608defd9e15621">Provisional Purification</A></H3>
<P>(78) Next is purifying your confusion into deep awareness. Of the stages for (this) point, the provisional and ultimate, the first is the provisional (purification, dealing with) the time (when you have) a pathway of mind of practicing (to actualize the goal). By familiarising yourself by means of profound methods, whatever disturbing emotions arise totally purify into the sphere (of deep awareness). To make manifest (the underlying) deep awareness which is the natural clarity (of the mind) is called “purifying conceptual thoughts of confusion into the sphere of deep awareness.”</P>
<P>(79) That (provisional stage) can be divided into shared, special, and unsurpassable (methods) according to the methods on which you rely. (These are respectively) cleansing away (the confusion of disturbing emotions) with their antidotes; transforming (them) with methods; and having them purify into the sphere (of deep awareness) without (need for) abandoning them, (since) they automatically liberate themselves in their own place. Regardless of how you train with whichever (method) you like, stopping (the disturbing emotions) comes to the same point as the disturbing emotions (automatically) purifying themselves.</P>
<P>(80) When you recognise the natural ground for the arising of longing desire, hostility, naivety, pride, and <SPAN class="tool" title="A disturbing emotion that focuses on other peoples&lsquo; accomplishments &ndash; such as their good qualities, possessions, or success &ndash; and is the inability to bear their accomplishments, due to excessive attachment to one&lsquo;s own gain or to the respect one receives. Also translated as &#39;envy.&#39;">jealousy</SPAN>, (you see that) they automatically settle and automatically liberate themselves, purifying into the five aspects of deep awareness. This is called “provisionally purifying the confusion of the five poisonous emotions into the (five) major deep awarenesses” – analytic, mirror-like, sphere of <SPAN class="tool" title="A nontechnical term for what actually exists.">reality</SPAN>, equalising, and accomplishing.</P>
<H3 class="h4"><A name="n22f4608defd9e15622" id="n22f4608defd9e15622">Ultimate Purification</A></H3>
<P>(81) The ultimate (purification) is the parting of (all) fleeting <SPAN class="tool" title="stain:Something that obscures the Buddha-nature factors, preventing them from being fully realized.">stains</SPAN> from the source. In other words, when you discover the purified state that is stilled and parted from any speck (of defilement), you make manifest the functional nature of the sphere just as it is and discover the deep awareness of the three Enlightening <SPAN class="tool" title="Corpus of a Buddha:A network of enlightening features or aspects of a Buddha, such as those of a Buddha&lsquo;s body, speech, or mind, which are attained with enlightenment and which help to lead others to enlightenment.">Corpuses of a Buddha</SPAN> as being of one taste in Dharmakaya. (This) is called the Corpus of the Sphere Possessing Double Purity. It is not a cognitive object (knowable) by anyone other than the Triumphant (Buddhas) themselves.</P>
<P>(82) The three Enlightening Corpuses (of a Buddha), namely a Corpus Encompassing Everything (Dharmakaya), a <SPAN class="tool" title="(1) According to sutra, the network of subtle forms, which make full use of the Mahayana teachings, and in which a Buddha appears in order to teach arya bodhisattvas. (2) According to non-Kalachakra anuttarayoga tantra, the network of all the speech of a Buddha. (3) According to Kalachakra, the network of both the subtle forms and the speech of a Buddha. Also called Body of Full Use. Some translators render this term as &#39;Enjoyment Body.&#39;">Corpus of Full Use</SPAN> (Sambhogakaya), and a <SPAN class="tool" title="The network of grosser forms, which are emanations of a Buddha&lsquo;s Corpus of Full Use, and in which a Buddha appears in order to teach ordinary beings with the karma to be able to meet with them. Also translated sometimes as &#39;Emanation Body.&#39;">Corpus of Emanations</SPAN> (Nirmanakaya), together with deep awareness, are incorporated into a <SPAN class="tool" title="Corpus of Essential Nature:(1) In the Gelug non-Kalachakra system, the voidness of a Buddha&lsquo;s omniscient mind and its state of being parted from the two sets of obscurations. (2) In the Gelug Kalachakra system, the blissful awareness aspect of a Buddha&lsquo;s omniscient mind. (3) In the Non-Gelug systems, the inseparability of all the Corpuses of a Buddha - equivalent to the inseparability of the two truths. Also called: Body of Essential Nature, Nature Body.">Corpus of Essential Nature</SPAN> (Svabhavakaya), which is static, all-<SPAN class="tool" title="&#39;x&#39; is pervasive with &#39;y&#39; if, whenever &#39;x&#39; is the case, so is &#39;y&#39;. Used in such formulations as &#39;If &#39;x&#39; is the case, then it is pervasive that &#39;y&#39; is the case.&#39;">pervasive</SPAN>, unaffected, and without shift or change.</P>
<P>(83) It remains in the sphere of Dharmakaya, which is a wish-fulfilling gem, and, within that state of its real nature, its Deep Awareness Corpus of Enlightening Influence, as a glittering play of Corpuses of Full Use and of Emanations, appears (respectively) to those with (<SPAN class="tool" title="A bodhisattva that has attained nonconceptual cognition of voidness.">arya bodhisattva</SPAN>) levels of <EM>bhumi</EM>-mind and to other wandering beings.</P>
<P>(84) Further, it appears like that from the purifying (power) of the combination of the strengths of the enlightening <SPAN class="tool" title="(1) A transformation that someone or something confers, literally by means of a &#39;brightening,&#39; into a state of heightened power and ability resembling the position or status of the person or thing that confers it. (2) In the meaning of &#39;elevation,&#39; transformation of one&lsquo;s body, speech, and mind, or offering substances, into pure aspects, done during a tantric ritual. Some translators render the term as &#39;blessing.&#39;">inspiration</SPAN> of the Triumphant Ones and the positive force of the disciples to be tamed. Because (of that purifying power, the attainment of) the enlightening influence (of a Buddha) fulfilling the hopes (of all limited beings), like a wish-granting tree or gem, without any break for as long as compulsive existence endures – this is called “the (ultimate) purification of confusion into deep awareness.”</P>
<P>(85) May the seven-horse-drawn (sun), which is the heart-essence of the profound meaning (explained) like that, shed thousands of light-rays of its various words and their meanings on the world of disciples through the pathway of the sky of their minds and clear away the darkness of unawareness from all wandering beings.</P>
<P>This (concludes) the fourth chapter of <EM>A Precious Garland</EM> <EM>for the Four Themes (of Gampopa)</EM>, “Purifying Confusion into Deep Awareness.”</P>
<H2 class="h3"><A name="n22f4608defd9e15623" id="n22f4608defd9e15623">Author’s Colophon</A></H2>
<P>(86) This spread of a banquet (laid out) for the sake of both myself and others from the magnificent mansion of the broad <SPAN class="tool" title="The ability to discriminate between what is correct and what is incorrect, and between what is helpful and what is harmful.">intelligence</SPAN> of these (Dharma) methods, and garnished with a lavish amount of hearing, thinking and meditating, has been arranged in accordance with the meaning of the sutras, tantras, and heart-essence quintessence teachings.</P>
<P>(87) By the constructive (force) of this, may I and all wandering beings level the mountain of compulsive samsaric existence in this lifetime and attain a supreme purified state that is stilled and parted from any speck (of defilement). May we become Buddhas, completely fulfilling the aims of both ourselves and others.</P>
<P>(88) And then in a land beautified with expansive snow-mountains of clear meaning, may (the sun of our) lustrous good qualities, which extends to the limit of (all) directions, highlight the heart-essence points on the precious gems of the scriptures and (thereby) bring joy to the masses of people with belief in what’s fact.</P>
<P>This work, called “A Precious Garland for the Four Themes (of Gampopa),” has been composed by the yogi of the Supreme Vehicle, Kunkyen Ngaggi-wangpo (Longchen Rabjampa), illumined by the crystal moon in the magnificent mansion of Samantabhadra in a garden called “A Cloud of Flowers” on the slopes of Limestone Mountain and completed in one sitting.</P>
<P>May a rain of great bliss fall for all times and in all directions as in the (golden) age of a complete eon, granting everything hoped for in everyone’s wishes.</P>
